# React JW Player video switcher

A little experiment to see if you can coordinate the switching of a playing
video across devices. Turns out you can, and quite nicely too.

For this simple experiment Iâ€™m using [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) to
hold the shared state and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) to handle
the UI components.

Open up the video switcher on both your PC and mobile device. Get the video
playing on both and then select a different video on your PC. This should switch
the playing video on your mobile device too.
